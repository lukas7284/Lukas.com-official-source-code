<p>you might wonder.</p>
<p>&quot;how was this website made and how did this look like before it was 
published&quot;</p>
<p>this page reveals it all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in retro zone I said that this was made using
<a href="http://theoldnet.com/get?decode=false&scripts=false&timestamp=20071011030606&url=http://www.frontpage2003.com/frontpage_2003.htm">
FrontPage 2003.</a></p>
<p>why did I use this? more modern website creation tools force me to make 
designs I don't like</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here is a example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>apparently old software is the only way to have a custom look so I tried it.</p>
<p>you can either use a Google docs kind of maker or you can use html. both ways 
you can make any kind of web ui. (almost)</p>
<p>the only downside is form entering without a 404 and compatibility.</p>
<p>in a early html version of this site. I would add links to older html pages I 
made a long time ago.</p>
<p>but this was my first true website.</p>
<p>i removed them as it was worthless to add links to pages no one else but me 
has access to</p>
<p><img border="0" src="old%20site%20buttons.png" width="693" height="120"></p>
<p>links to old pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>unique backgrounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>holidays, photos of the month, and !!!! all have a non loading background. 
there all unique and if it would load, it would make the chaos page more intense 
looking.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="behind1.jpg" width="444" height="370"></p>
<p>how holidays was supposed to look.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="behind2.jpg" width="436" height="386"></p>
<p>how photo's of the month was supposed to look.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="behind3.jpg" width="468" height="410"></p>
<p>how !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! was supposed to look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="behind4.jpg" width="892" height="712"></p>
<p>what it looks like when im making a page.</p>
